The Information Controls Lab Project (ICLab for short) aims to build a scalable software platform designed to run measurements, collect data, and analyze data to reliably detect online information controls across the globe. Abbas leads the project on ICLab in collaboration with researchers from the Citizen Lab in University of Torontoâ€™s Munk School of Global Affairs and Princeton University. Starting with a few hundred lines of code and two test clients in the lab in 2014, ICLab has now been expanded to around 15,000 lines of code and hundreds of VPN and Raspberry Pi clients spread across more than 180 countries running close to one million URL measurements per week. We have also worked to expand our multi-disciplinary collaboration network to other institutions and measurement platforms to further our capabilities.
